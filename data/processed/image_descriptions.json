The table has rows representing different evaluation metrics (e.g., MMLU, GPQA, MATH, HumanEval, etc.) and columns for different language models (e.g., phi-4, phi-3, Qwen 2.5, GPT, Llama-3.3).  Each cell contains a numerical value, representing a score or percentage.  Examples of numerical values include: 84.8, 77.9, 56.1, 31.2, 42.9, 40.9, 49.1, 49.0, 50.6, 80.4, 44.6, etc.  The table headers also include specific model configurations like \"14b\", \"14b instruct\", \"40-mini\", \"70b instruct\", \"72b instruct\".",
